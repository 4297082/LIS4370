## Introduction

This document describes the functions in the "SoccerPlayerRating" R package. This package helps analyze a soccer player's average rating over the last `x` games.

## Function 1: `calculate_avg_rating()`

This function calculates the player's average rating over the last `x` games.


# Function to calculate the average rating over the last x games
calculate_avg_rating <- function(player_data, x) {
  avg_rating <- mean(tail(player_data$rating, x))
  return(avg_rating)
  
  
  This function generates a plot that shows how the player's ratings change over time, using the game ID as the x-axis and the rating as the y-axis. It helps visualize trends in the player's performance.

Example Usage
In this step, you can use the plot_player_performance() function to visualize how the player's ratings evolve across games.
