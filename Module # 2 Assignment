assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2)) }

> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25

How the code works:
sum(assignment2) adds up all the numbers in the list.
length(assignment2) tells you how many numbers are in the list.
Dividing the total sum by the number of numbers gives us the mean.

The function works because it correctly calculated the average of the numbers. Adding all the numbers and dividing by how many there are gives the average which is 19.25.
